# CS 6381 Final Project (Team 3)

## Project Overview: ##
We will be using Apache Spark, a leading distributed computing framework, to analyze a Netflix dataset to predict which shows/movies users will enjoy. We will show the effect of training amount and regularization on the accuracy of the task, as well as the speedup (if any) afforded by using more cores.

## Project Goals: ##

* Use Apache Spark and Vanderbilt University's ACCRE cluster to perform predictive analysis on a large dataset.  
* Run the job with varying amounts of training to show the effect on accuracy.
* Test the data against different models with different regularization parameters to analyze the impact of overfitting the data.
* Run the job using different numbers of cores to analyze the speedup caused by increased cores.
